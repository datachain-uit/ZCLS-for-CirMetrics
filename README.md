# ZCLS-for-CirMetrics

This repository contains the **research implementation** used in our research paper: **"ZCLS: A Lifecycle Strategy for Efficient ZK-Rollup Circuit Optimization in Circom"**. 

The codebase includes a minimal, educational implementation of a ZK-Rollup system on Ethereum, along with CirMetrics — a supporting tool designed to monitor and analyze circuit performance metrics during development. This setup enables reproducibility of our experimental results and facilitates further research in ZK circuit optimization.

[Watch the demo video of CirMetrics](https://youtu.be/a_X8ZK8VE98) in action to see how the tool visualizes constraint counts, compilation times, and proof generation metrics across different optimization levels.

## 🔬 Key Research Contributions

**ZCLS (ZK Circuit Lifecycle Strategy)**: A practical, stage-aware framework for selecting Circom compiler optimization flags (-O0, -O1, -O2) based on development phase, update frequency, and proof generation volume. ZCLS helps developers balance compilation speed and proving efficiency throughout the circuit lifecycle.

**Performance Trade-off Analysis**: Empirical evaluation on ZK-Rollup circuits demonstrates that -O2 reduces constraints by up to 73.2% and proving time by 64.3%, but increases compilation time by 162.75% at batch size 64. This highlights a critical trade-off between development speed and proving efficiency.

**CirMetrics Tool**: A comprehensive tool for analyzing and visualizing circuit metrics (constraints, time, memory), circuit update frequency, and proof generation volume, enabling data-driven decisions when applying ZCLS.

## 💻 Usage

### ZK-Rollup Benchmark

Follow the workflow below to run and benchmark the ZK-Rollup (every steps from now on start from src directory):

#### Step 1: ⚡ ZK Circuit Setup

**Generate Powers of Tau for Trusted Setup**

```bash
sh -x scripts/setup1-powersoftau.sh
```

> **Note**: Instead of generating manually, you can download a pre-generated `.ptau` file from [SNARKJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) to save time. Ensure the `.ptau` file size supports your circuit's constraint count (e.g., `pot16_final.ptau` supports up to 2¹⁶ constraints). Save the `.ptau` file in `src/ptau` as `potXX_final.ptau` with XX as the power of two for compatibility. The example batch size is set to 4 with maximum constraints of 213,846, so `pot19_final.ptau` is sufficient.

**Compile Circuits and Generate Verification Artifacts**

You can configure the optimization level and observe circuit compilation metrics through this step:

```bash
sh -x scripts/setup2-circuit-compilation.sh RollupValidator
sh -x scripts/setup2-circuit-compilation.sh ExitValidator
```

**Export Solidity Verifier Contracts**

```bash
# Export RollupValidator
cd RollupValidator_js
snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier rollupvalidator_final.zkey ../contracts/RollupValidator.sol
cd ..

# Export ExitValidator  
cd ExitValidator_js
snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier exitvalidator_final.zkey ../contracts/ExitValidator.sol
cd ..
```

> **Important**: Edit the exported Solidity files to rename contract classes to exactly `"RollupValidator"` and `"ExitValidator"`. The default names may be something like `"Groth16Verifier"`.

#### Step 2: 📄 Contract Preparation

**Generate Poseidon Hash Contracts**

```bash
node scripts/poseidonGenerator.mjs
```

**Compile Smart Contracts**

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

#### Step 3: 🌐 Network Deployment and ZK-Rollup Execution

**Launch Local Blockchain (separate terminal)**

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

**Deploy Smart Contracts and Execute ZK-Rollup**

**Option 1: Automated Running (Recommended)**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command automatically:
- Resets the Hardhat network
- Deploys fresh contracts  
- Executes the ZK-Rollup simulation

Use this command to rerun the ZK-Rollup subsequent times (with the Hardhat node running).

**Option 2: Manual Running**

Deploy contracts:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.mjs --network localhost
```

Run the simulation:
```bash
npx hardhat run app.mjs --network localhost
```

**ZK-Rollup Operation Flow:**

1. **Setup Phase**: Creates user accounts with predefined balances
2. **Deposit Phase**: Deposits tokens to L2 via L1 contract
3. **Transaction Phase**: Processes batch transfers between accounts
4. **Proving Phase**: Generates ZK proofs for transaction validity
5. **Verification Phase**: Verifies proofs and updates L1 state
6. **Withdrawal Phase**: Demonstrates secure asset withdrawal


### 📊 CirMetrics

The `srcDemo/` directory contains CirMetrics source code, including frontend and backend:

#### Step 1: Install frontend packages

```bash
cd src/srcDemo/Frontend 
npm i
npm run dev
```

#### Step 2: Install backend packages and download ptau file

Download pot19 ptau file (save as pot19_final.ptau in src/srcDemo/Backend/src/ptau) from [SNARKJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) for small circuits testing, then run commands below:

```bash
cd src/srcDemo/Backend/src
npm i
node app.js
```

- Backend runs on port 5002
- Frontend runs on port 5173

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Batch Size Configuration

For modifying the ZK-Rollup batch size, configuration changes are required in both the circuits and main application file, followed by complete system recompilation.

#### Step 1: Application Configuration

Modify the `ROLLUP_CONFIG` object in `app.mjs`:

```javascript
const ROLLUP_CONFIG = {
    ACCOUNT_TREE_DEPTH: 8,      // Max 2^8 = 256 accounts
    TRANSACTION_TREE_DEPTH: 2,  // Max 2^2 = 4 transactions per batch
    BATCH_SIZE: 4,              // Current batch size for testing
    ACTIVE_ACCOUNTS: 3,         // Number of accounts to use
    TRANSFER_AMOUNT: 1          // Amount per transfer
}
```

#### Step 2: Circuit Configuration

For different batch sizes, update circuit parameters:

**Edit Circuit Files**
```circom
// circuits/RollupValidator.circom
component main { public [ transactionRoot, initialStateRoot, finalStateRoot ] } 
= RollupValidator(8, 2);  // (accountDepth, transactionDepth)
```

**Recompile ZK Circuits** (follow the circuit compilation step)

> **Note**: Configure the ptau file in scripts2 according to your batch size. Larger batch sizes require more constraints and correspondingly larger ptau files.

### Optimization Levels

Control circuit optimization during compilation:

```bash
# No optimization (faster compilation, larger constraints)
sh -x scripts/setup2-circuit-compilation.sh RollupValidator o0

# Default optimization  
sh -x scripts/setup2-circuit-compilation.sh RollupValidator
# or
sh -x scripts/setup2-circuit-compilation.sh RollupValidator o1

# Maximum optimization (slower compilation, fewer constraints)
sh -x scripts/setup2-circuit-compilation.sh RollupValidator o2
```

### Memory Configuration

For larger batch sizes, increase Node.js memory allocation:

```bash
# For batch sizes 64-128
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"

# For batch sizes 128+ use space size of 16384 or higher
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=16384"
```
## 📈 Performance Metrics

The application automatically tracks and displays comprehensive performance metrics for batch processing and withdrawal operations:

### Batch Processing Metrics
- **Proving Time**: Circuit proof creation time
- **Proof Size**: Generated proof file size in bytes
- **Local Verification Time**: Local proof verification duration
- **Onchain Verification Time**: L1 contract verification duration
- **Gas Usage**: L1 transaction gas consumption

### Withdrawal Metrics
- **Withdrawal Proving Time**: Exit proof generation time
- **Withdrawal Verification Time**: Exit proof verification time
- **Withdrawal Gas Usage**: Gas cost for withdrawal transactions

### Circuit Compilation Metrics

Circuit compilation metrics can be observed during the circuit compilation phase:
### Compilation Metrics
- **Constraint Count**: Total number of constraints (linear and non-linear) — a key indicator of circuit complexity and proving cost
- **Compilation Time**: Time to compile high-level circuit to R1CS; critical for development speed and iteration efficiency
